        "Developed a full-stack web application that enables users to register, securely log in, and manage personal notes with CRUD functionality. Upon registration, user passwords are hashed for security, and each user receives a unique JWT (JSON Web Token) for session authentication. Users can create, read, update, and delete their notes, with secure access ensured by the JWT token. A logout feature clears the JWT token, effectively logging the user out.React.js for the front-end interface, Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic and API creation, MongoDB for data storage, and Tailwind CSS for responsive UI design.",

Users can browse all products without authentication, but adding items to the cart requires login. The app includes secure user registration with hashed passwords and JWT-based authentication. Logged-in users can add products to their cart, view items, update quantities, and remove products, with cart data securely tied to their account and stored in a database for session persistence. Cart data is retrieved across devices upon login. A logout feature clears the JWT token, ensuring secure session termination. Built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.",
